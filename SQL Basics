🔢 What is Data?
Data is raw information — facts, figures, or values that don’t make much sense on their own.

📌 Example:

Customer ID: 1023

Shipping Date: 2025-05-28

Think of data as building blocks — we need to organize and process them to extract meaning.

💡 What is Information?
Information is data that has been processed or structured to be useful.
It’s the "meaningful version" of data.

📌 Example:

“Customer ID 1023 placed an order on 2025-05-28 from Canada.”

Now it's no longer just numbers — it's useful insight!

🏛️ What is a Database?
A Database is a collection of organized, related, and structured data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.

🔹 It’s like a digital filing cabinet for your information.

🔗 Types of Databases
📘 Relational Database (SQL)
Stores data in tables (rows and columns)

Uses SQL (Structured Query Language)

Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server

📦 NoSQL Database (Non-relational)
Used for large-scale, unstructured, or flexible data

Types:

Key-Value (like a dictionary) → Redis, DynamoDB

Document Store → MongoDB

Graph Store → Neo4j

Column Store → Cassandra

📊 SQL Table Structure
Field Name	Description	Example Value
Customer ID	Primary Key (unique)	1023
First Name	Attribute/Column	Alice
Last Name	Attribute/Column	Johnson
Country	Column Value	USA

🧠 In SQL:

Row = Record = Tuple

Column = Field = Attribute

Cell = Individual data item
